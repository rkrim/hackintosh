This is a guide to install macOS on my hardware

## 1. Know the hardware

- Dell XPS 13 9350 - [Specifications](https://github.com/rkrim/hackintosh/tree/master/dell-xps13-9350)
- Intel NUC8i5BEK - [Specifications](https://github.com/rkrim/hackintosh/tree/master/intel-nuc8-i5bek)

## 2. Download macOS Installer

- From MacAppStore if already using macOS
  - [macOS Big Sur](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/macos-big-sur/id1526878132), latest known version: 11.0.1.
  - [macOS Catalina](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/macos-catalina/id1466841314), latest known version: 10.15.7.

## 3. Create a bootable macOS usb installer

### a. Create the installer

Make sure that the USB disk is formated in HFS+J (Mac OS Extended Journaled) and has GUID Partition Map scheme.

Use the 'createinstallmedia' command in Terminal.
Follow instructions on Apple documentation about [how to create a bootable installer for macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372).

Here is an extract for Big Sur and Catalina

```
NOTE: Make sure to replace 'MyVolume' with the right USB volume name in the below commands.

## macOS Big Sur
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

## macOS Catalina
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
```

### b. EFI Partition
At this step, we have a bootable macOS USB Installer that can be used to install macOS on Apple Computers.

To make it bootable on other computers, we need to mount the EFI partition of the USB disk and add a bootloader and by the way, add required firmware drivers, kexts, patches and other needed stuff.

To mount the EFI partition, open terminal and type the following:  
- List all disks and partitions  
`sudo diskutil list`  
```
/dev/disk2 (external, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *7.9 GB     disk2
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                7.5 GB     disk2s2
```
- Find and mount the EFI partition, in the example, it's `disk 2` and `partition 1`.  
`sudo diskutil mount disk2s1`

### c. Bootloader
There is a lot of bootloader projects out there, the most popular ones are Clover and OpenCore.
When you can, always choose OpenCore as it has a better and more secure approach ([Why OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/why-oc.html)).

This step is computer specific, so go to the right section on the right hardware directry.

## Modify BIOS/UEFI Settings

Depending on computers, some components and/or settings can prevent macOS from booting or installing correctly.

Those components needs to be turned off and settings needs to be changed to let macOS works correctly.

- **Compatibility Support Module / CSM**:
The Compatibility Support Module is a UEFI component that emulates legacy BIOS to provide compatibility to legacy operating systems that don't recognize UEFI systems.
Both Clover and OpenCore bootloaders supports UEFI Booting.  
**Disable CSM**

- **Secure Boot**:
Secure Boot prevents booting an unsigned Bootloader. It is not supported by Clover or OpenCore.  
**Disable Secure Boot**

- **OS Type**:
This generally goes with `Secure boot` and optimizes some functions depending on the OS.  
**OS Type: Other OS**

- **SATA controller mode**:
Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) mode enables the use of advanced features on SATA drives, like Native Command Queuing (NCQ) and also makes them operate at higher speeds than in legacy IDE mode.  
**SATA mode: AHCI**

- **CFG Lock**:
CFG Lock prevents writing to certain region in the BIOS. If macOS canâ€™t access those regions, it won't boot.
This option is sometimes enabled and hidden from user.  
**Disable CFG Lock**

- **Intel Virtualization Technology / VT or VT-x**:
Found on Intel CPU, this enhances virtualization softwares. It sometimes prevents macOS from installing correctly.  
**Disable Intel VT-x until install finishes**

- **Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed IO / VT-d / IOMMU**:
An extension that allows physical hardware access under a virtual-machine. It sometimes prevents macOS from installing correctly.  
**Disable VT-d until install finishes**

## Install macOS

Install macOS like on a regular Apple computer.

## Post Install

- Copy bootloader and all other files in EFI folder from usb disk to the disk where macOS was installed.
- From now on you can unplug the installer usb disk.
- When possible, undo changes made in BIOS and/or UEFI
- Reboot.

## Useful commands

### Recovery mode
  - To boot in recovery mode from macOS, open Terminal and type:
    ```
    sudo nvram "recovery-boot-mode=unused"
    sudo reboot
    ```
  - To get back to regular boot, from macOS Recovery mode, open Terminal and type:
    ```
    nvram -d recovery-boot-mode
    ```
